# Sir Quiz-A-Lot desktop application
# I didn't delete any previous work, I just couldn't use "input" and things like that with the GUI
# It's all at the bottom commented out.
# Since we aren't using version control, try to comment out my code instead of deleting..
# we can clean it up later.
# Was also thinking about finding a way to put all of the repetitive code like padx pady font and color into variables or
# a function so that it wont be so repetitive. That can be a stretch goal. - K
